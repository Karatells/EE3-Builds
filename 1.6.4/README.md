More items have base EMC values, and things made with them now have EMC values.  (Much still to do on this.)

Tweaks to Commit # 1158 for better code. Duplicate code fix from ganymedes01, and translations from Vexatos, Pulsior, and Xetosphere. Splitting Item, Block, General, and Transmutation into separate configurations. Made some methods general for easier adding of additional classes.
(DynEMC is done! w00t!) Renaming classes, removed unused FuelHandler class.

Still highly unstable.

Since I last posted?  Massive localization changes, and more work on DynEMC.  EE3 was just made compilable in 1.6.4 ~today.

The only "visible" changes were a new Alchemy Table which has not been coded in yet, and some name changes.
